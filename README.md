#Welcome To GammJS
A simple library that you can use to create block templates that can easily be manipulated and add methods or events to a certain element in the document.

This library also helps you to learn a few tricks to create a good user-interface website that can easily be designed using this library.

This library is mostly used to create my projects and will help me to easily integrate javascript events to my HTML codes. This library is powered purely by javascript but you can combine both HTML and javascript integration on a said syntax that I will be showing you on this document so sit back and read!

This library might be familiar to you like famous frameworks out there on the internet like Angular.js by Google, React.js by Facebook, and Vue.js by Evan You. This library is almost similar to these 3 famous frameworks but this one like Vue.js doesn't need any complications on installing or integrating into your projects. It is light and easy to use than these 3 famous frameworks already in the market.


#Integration
Integration is as easy us this:
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="[path_to_library]/gamm.js"></script>
```
